# webscraping
The goal of this project is to build a web scraper in Python to extract data from a provided 
website.  See the guidelines below:
1. The scraper should paginate through at least the first 5 pages of the site.
2. Extract the title and content of each page into a JSON file with keys 'title' and 
'content'.
3. Convert all html tables into markdown format. 
4. Focus on robust scraping to get clean data - avoid scraping sidebars, ads, social 
media links, etc.
5. Handle edge cases where page formats differ
